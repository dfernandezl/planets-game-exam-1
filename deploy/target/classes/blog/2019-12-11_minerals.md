# Minerals

Did you have seen that you could build ships for free?
Well, it was a little lie. You need minerals to build ships.
Fortunately all planets have some raw available minerals to use,
but you population should dig for more if you want to build more ships.

## Dig minerals

### Create one player map

Create a map with one player:

 > Click _New_ in the main header. 
 > Type _TwoStars_ into the _map code_.  
 > Click the _Add player_ button.  
 > Type _sisko_ into the _Player 1_.  
 > click the _Create_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT create status=200 -->
 
### Minerals ready to use

In the beginning, stars have some minerals
ready to use and a reserve.
 
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _5_,
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _100_,

Each turn the population digs some minerals
and accumulate them on the surface.

 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile2 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _2_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _8_,
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _97_.

### Ships are made of minerals

You need minerals to build ships.
When you build a ship, required minerals are consumed from the available reserve.

 > Type _Defiant_ into its _new ship name_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile3 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _3_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _6_,
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _94_.
 > And you see the _ship_ _Defiant_.
  
### People extracts mineral

The speed of mineral extraction depends on the population
of your star. More people more speed, less people, less mineral.

 > Type _90_ into its _load_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile4 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _4_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _7_,
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _93_, and
 > it has a _population_ of _10_.

One more turn.
 
 > Click the _Compile_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile5 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _5_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _8_,  
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _92_, and  
 > it has a _population_ of _11_.  

Now minerals are extracted more slowly.

### No minerals no ships

We can build just few ships with available minerals.
After that, we should wait for more minerals.

 > Type _Rio Grande_ into its _new ship name_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile6 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _6_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _4_,  
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _91_.  

But we cannot build the second third ship because there are not enough minerals.

 > Type _Ganges_ into its _new ship name_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile7 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _7_.  
 > there is a message telling _Cannot build ship Ganges due to a lack of available minerals_.  
 > Click that message.  
 > You see no _ship_ _Ganges_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _5_,  
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _90_.  

### Extract minerals until exhaustion

Your people will dig minerals until exhaustion.
Unload all people, and pass turns to see how minerals descends.

 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.  
 > Type _-90_ into its _load_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile8 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _8_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.  
 > it has a _population_ of _4_  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _population_ of _100_,  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _8_,  
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _87_.  

Pass and pass turns.

 > Click the _Compile_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile9 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _9_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _11_,  
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _84_.  
 
 > Skip turns from _9_ to _34_.
 > It is the turn number _34_.  

Just compile few more turns...

 > Click the _Compile_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile35 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _35_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _89_,  
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _6_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile36 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _36_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _92_,  
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _3_.

 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile37 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _37_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _95_,  
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _0_.  

And that is all. There are no more minerals to dig.

 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile38 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _38_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_,  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _95_,  
 > it has a _minerals reserve_ of _0_.
