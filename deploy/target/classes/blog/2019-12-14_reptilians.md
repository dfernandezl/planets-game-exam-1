# Reptilians

Beign human is nice, but beign a sadic,
cold bloded, fascist, totalitarian, 
highed evolved lizard is even better.


## Beign a reptilian

### Create the arena

Create a map with two player:

 > Click _New_ in the main header.  
 > Type _TwoStars_ into the _map code_.    
 > Click the _Add player_ button.  
 > Type _sisko_ into the _Player 1_.  
 > Select _Human_ into the _Race 1_.  
 > Click the _Add player_ button.  
 > Type _garak_ into the _Player 2_.  
 > Select _Reptilian_ into the _Race 2_.  
 > Click the _Create_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT create status=200 -->
 
### Reptilians reproduce more slowly

Create a ship for each player.

 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > It is the turn number _1_.  
 > The current player is _sisko_.  
 > The current race is _human_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > Type _Defiant_ into its _new ship name_.  
 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT garak1 status=200 -->
 >
 > It is the turn number _1_.  
 > The current player is _garak_.  
 > The current race is _reptilian_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.  
 > Type _Ravinok_ into its _new ship name_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT garak2 status=200 -->

Upload 60 of population to each ship.

 > It is the turn number _2_.  
 > The current player is _garak_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.
 > It has a _population_ of _100_.
 > You see the _ship_ _Ravinok_.  
 > Type _60_ into its _load_.
 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT sisko2 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _2_.  
 > The current player is _sisko_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.
 > It has a _population_ of _100_.
 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.  
 > Type _60_ into its _load_. 
 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT sisko3 status=200 -->

Now see how populations grow in both of both. Before:

 > It is the turn number _3_.  
 > The current player is _sisko_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.
 > It has a _population_ of _40_.
 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT garak3 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _3_.  
 > The current player is _garak_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.
 > It has a _population_ of _40_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT garak4 status=200 --> 

And after:

 > It is the turn number _4_.  
 > The current player is _garak_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.
 > It has a _population_ of _42_.
 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT sisko4 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _4_.  
 > The current player is _sisko_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.
 > It has a _population_ of _44_.

### Reptilians also dig slower

They are lazy, they want slaves to do the 
work for them. They love conquer other planets
right in place.

 > The current race is _human_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _7_,  
 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT garak4a status=200 -->
 >
 > The current race is _reptilian_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.
 > it has a _minerals availability_ of _4_,

They can crunch your skull with a single hand.
When body to body fight, they destroy humans.
