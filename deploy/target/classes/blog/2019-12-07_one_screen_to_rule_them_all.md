# One screen to rule them all

Until now, each time that you wanted to know more about one location
in the space, you have to click, see the details and go back.

Today we are changing that: now the map will be always visible and
you will be able to click directly about your items.

## See all in one

### Start the game

Create a map to play.

 Click _New_ in the main header.  
 Type _TwoStars_ into the _map code_.  
 Click the _Create_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT create status=200 -->
 
And login.
 
 Click _Play_ in the main header.  
 Type your username.  
 Click the _Log in_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT loginGame status=200 -->
 
 Now you see the _map of the game_.
 There is a _star_ at coordinates _3,3_ and
 there is a _star_ at coordinates _3,4_.

### All in one

 Click at coordinates _3,3_.
 
The map is still present, 
 cell _3,3_ is highlighted, and
 you see the _star_ _Bajor_ in the side view.
You can create a ship,
 type _Defiant_ into its _new ship name_.

Because you are on the map you can still navigate.

 Click at coordinates _3,4_,
 cell _3,4_ is highlighted,
 and you see the _star_ _Cardassia_.

and back  

 Click at coordinates _3,3_,
 cell _3,3_ is highlighted,
 then you see the _star_ _Bajor_,
 and it has _Defiant_ typed into the _new ship name_.
 
### Now is your turn

Mechanics are the same, but now you are more agile playing.
