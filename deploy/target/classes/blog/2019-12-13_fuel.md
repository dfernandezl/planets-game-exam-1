# Fuel

We did not tell you before, but 
ships require fuel to move. It is basic.
Luckily starbases turns solar flares into
fuel for free, every turn, without rest.


## Fueling ships

### Create two player map

Create a map with two player:

 > Click _New_ in the main header.  
 > Type _TwoStars_ into the _map code_.    
 > Click the _Add player_ button.  
 > Type _sisko_ into the _Player 1_.  
 > Click the _Add player_ button.  
 > Type _garak_ into the _Player 2_.  
 > click the _Create_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT create status=200 -->
 
### One ship with fuel

Ships are initially built with fuel.
Just create a ship and move away until it is depleted.

 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > Type _Defiant_ into its _new ship name_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile2 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _2_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _5_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  

### Movement takes fuel

You can move the ship, it consumes fuel at each movement.

 > Click its button to _go right_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile3 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _3_.
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.
 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.
 > It has a _fuel_ of _4_.
 > Click its button to _go right_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile4 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _4_.
 > Click at coordinates _3,5_.
 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.
 > It has a _fuel_ of _3_.

And you can move it until it consumes all the fuel.

 > Click its button to _go up_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile5 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _5_.
 > Click at coordinates _2,5_.
 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.
 > It has a _fuel_ of _2_.
 > Click its button to _go left_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile6 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _6_.
 > Click at coordinates _2,4_.
 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.
 > It has a _fuel_ of _1_.
 > Click its button to _go left_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile7 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _7_.
 > Click at coordinates _2,3_.
 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.
 > It has a _fuel_ of _0_.

### No fuel no movement

Once you run out of fuel, the ship will move no further.
It becomes stranded for ever.

 > Click its button to _go down_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile8 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _8_.
 > Click at coordinates _2,3_.
 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.
 > It has a _fuel_ of _0_.

### Starbases create fuel

Starbases are sitting in orbit.
They receive directly the heat from the star,
an they convert that heat into fuel.

Create one Starbase.

 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > Type _Deep Space 9_ into its _new starbase name_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile9 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _9_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _starbase_ _Deep Space 9_.   
 > It has a _fuel_ of _0_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  

As soon you let pass turns, the starbase refills itself.  

 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile10 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _10_.
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _starbase_ _Deep Space 9_.   
 > It has a _fuel_ of _2_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  

And continues refilling, until reaching its maximum capacity.

 > Skip turns from _10_ to _13_.  
 > It is the turn number _13_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _starbase_ _Deep Space 9_.   
 > It has a _fuel_ of _8_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile14 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _14_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _starbase_ _Deep Space 9_.   
 > It has a _fuel_ of _10_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  

Once reached this point, it stops generating fuel.

 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile15 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _15_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _starbase_ _Deep Space 9_.   
 > It has a _fuel_ of _10_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  

### Refueling ships

Starbases refuel ships automatically.
Ships just have to spend one turn near the starbase to be
refilled automatically.

 > Type _Rio Grande_ into its _new ship name_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile16 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _16_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Rio Grande_.  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _5_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_. 

Which is the initial fuel. If we spare one turn.

 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile17 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _17_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Rio Grande_.  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _10_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_. 
 > You see the _starbase_ _Deep Space 9_.   
 > It has a _fuel_ of _7_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  

If we create more ships, it will refill all the 
ships until fuel is consumed.

 > Type _Ganges_ into its _new ship name_.
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.
 > Type _Yangtzee Kiang_ into its _new ship name_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile18 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _18_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Ganges_.  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _5_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_. 
 > You see the _ship_ _Yangtzee Kiang_.  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _5_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_. 
 > You see the _starbase_ _Deep Space 9_.   
 > It has a _fuel_ of _9_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  

And wait for refill.

 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile19 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _19_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Ganges_.  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _10_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_. 
 > You see the _ship_ _Yangtzee Kiang_.  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _9_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_. 
 > You see the _starbase_ _Deep Space 9_.   
 > It has a _fuel_ of _2_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  

One of the two ships had not enough, but at the next turn:

 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT compile20 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _20_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Yangtzee Kiang_.  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _10_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_. 
 > You see the _starbase_ _Deep Space 9_.   
 > It has a _fuel_ of _3_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  

### Others players ship

Each starbase only fills its own players ships.
If other ship comes your starbases will not refill it.

 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT garak20 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _20_.  
 > The current player is _garak_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_,  
 > Type _Ravinok_ into its _new ship name_.  
 >
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT garak21 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _21_.  
 > The current player is _garak_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Ravinok_,  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _5_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.  
 > Click its button to _go left_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT garak22 status=200 -->
 >  
 > It is the turn number _22_.  
 > The current player is _garak_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Ravinok_,  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _4_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.
 > You see the _starbase_ _Deep Space 9_.

Now it is the moment. Lets see if it is refilled.  

 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT garak23 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _23_.  
 > The current player is _garak_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Ravinok_,  
 > It has a _fuel_ of _4_, and  
 > it has a _total fuel capacity_ of _10_.

No refill.
