# Droids

They look human, walk human, fight human, work human,
but they are not made of creepy fragile flesh, they are built.
Born is too nasty for them.


## Beign a Droid

### Create the arena

Create a map with two player:

 > Click _New_ in the main header.  
 > Type _TwoStars_ into the _map code_.    
 > Click the _Add player_ button.  
 > Type _sisko_ into the _Player 1_.  
 > Select _Human_ into the _Race 1_.  
 > Click the _Add player_ button.  
 > Type _seven_ into the _Player 2_.  
 > Select _Droid_ into the _Race 2_.  
 > Click the _Create_ button.   
 <!-- SNAPSHOT create status=200 -->
 
### Droids do not reproduce

Create a ship for each player.

 > It is the turn number _1_.  
 > The current player is _sisko_.  
 > The current race is _human_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > Type _Defiant_ into its _new ship name_.  
 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT seven1 status=200 -->
 >
 > It is the turn number _1_.  
 > The current player is _seven_.  
 > The current race is _droid_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.  
 > Type _Marauder_ into its _new ship name_.  
 > Click the _Compile_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT seven2 status=200 -->

Upload 60 of population to each ship.

 > It is the turn number _2_.  
 > The current player is _seven_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.
 > It has a _population_ of _100_.
 > You see the _ship_ _Marauder_.  
 > Type _60_ into its _load_.
 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT sisko2 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _2_.  
 > The current player is _sisko_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.
 > It has a _population_ of _100_.
 > You see the _ship_ _Defiant_.  
 > Type _60_ into its _load_. 
 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT sisko3 status=200 -->

Now see how populations grow in both of both. Before:

 > It is the turn number _3_.  
 > The current player is _sisko_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.
 > It has a _population_ of _40_.
 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT seven3 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _3_.  
 > The current player is _seven_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.
 > It has a _population_ of _40_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT seven4 status=200 --> 

And after:

 > It is the turn number _4_.  
 > The current player is _seven_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.
 > It has a _population_ of _40_.
 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT sisko4 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _4_.  
 > The current player is _sisko_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.
 > It has a _population_ of _44_.

### Droids are built out of minerals

Droids are created at star factories.
You can create as many droids as you want, but 
it consumes mineral.

First load all the population on the ship.

 > Click the _Next_ button.  
 <!-- SNAPSHOT seven4a status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _4_.  
 > The current player is _seven_.  
 > The current race is _droid_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Marauder_.  
 > Type _43_ into its _load_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT seven5 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _5_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.  
 > It has a _minerals availability_ of _7_.    
 > It has a _population_ of _0_.  
 > You see the _ship_ _Marauder_.  
 > It has a _population_ of _100_.  

And now we discover how they reproduce:

 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.  
 > Type _3_ into its _build droids_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT seven6 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _6_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.  
 > It has a _minerals availability_ of _6_.    
 > It has a _population_ of _3_.  
 > Type _10_ into its _build droids_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT seven7 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _7_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.  
 > It has a _minerals availability_ of _5_.    
 > It has a _population_ of _13_.  
 > Type _999_ into its _build droids_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT seven8 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _8_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.  
 > It has a _minerals availability_ of _1_.    
 > It has a _population_ of _38_.

We can wait for more minerals, so we can build more droids.

 > Skip turns from _8_ to _20_. 
 > It is the turn number _20_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.  
 > It has a _minerals availability_ of _13_.    
 > It has a _population_ of _38_.
 > Type _999_ into its _build droids_.
 > Click the _Compile_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT seven21 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _21_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,4_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Cardassia_.  
 > It has a _minerals availability_ of _3_.    
 > It has a _population_ of _100_.
 
### Other races cannot build droids

They are enough smart to know that droids will conquer
them as soon as they leave the factory.

 > Click the _Next_ button.
 <!-- SNAPSHOT human21 status=200 -->
 > It is the turn number _21_.  
 > The current player is _sisko_.  
 > The current race is _human_.  
 > Click at coordinates _3,3_.  
 > You see the _star_ _Bajor_.  
 > You cannot type into its _build droids_.

### Now is your turn

So, how many petty humans you want destroy?
